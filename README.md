This repo contains use cases, designs and code for our open source project to build a sensor farm in the SRUK building. This is an ongoing project and in constant flux. Keep checking for updates.

All the content is in our WiKi and project folders. 

Why not get involved and have a look at the [WiKi](https://github.com/SamsungResearchUK-IoT-Meetup/projects/wiki) for details on the plan!
